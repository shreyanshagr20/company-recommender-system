# Which company is right for you?

In this project, I tried to build a recommendor system using verified company reviews from teamblind.com for companies in Consulting, Technology and Finance to understand which features such as work life balance, growth, learning etc. are associated with which companies.

Below are the high level steps outlined:
1. Scrap at least 50 and at most 300 reviews for each company
2. Data cleaning and pre processing
3. Association (LIFT) analysis to understand features associated with each company
4. Recommender system based on Bag of words cosine similartity b/w user specified attributes and reviews

Please refer to the Python notebook attached for further details.
